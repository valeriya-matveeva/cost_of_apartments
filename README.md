# Research of apartment sale listings

As part of my training in the Data Scientist field, I conducted a study on real estate listings in Russia. The goal of the study was to determine the factors influencing apartment prices: location, area, etc.

For each apartment listed for sale, there are two types of data available. The first type of data is provided by the users themselves, while the second type is generated automatically based on cartographic data. For example, distances to the city center, airport, and other facilities - this data is automatically obtained from geoservices.
